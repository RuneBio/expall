# NovoNordisk_Capstone
This repository contains the source code for our DIRECT capstone project with Novo Nordisk.
Our goal is to predict protein expression from nucleotide/amino acid sequence using the 
data set from Sastry et el. Their source code and original data files can be found 
at https://github.com/SBRG/Protein_ML.
